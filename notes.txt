    How to handle cross compiled results?

User experience:
    Configuration:
        - Plug in environment variables
        - Add zio-test-results Github action to ci.yml

Architecture
    External service for checking performance
    Github action for uploading results and feeding to Github App

TODO
    Figure out where to store results in the cloud
        -Append only
        -Semi structured
    Track flakiness details
    Look for
        ZIO_TEST_GITHUB_TOKEN
        ZIO_TEST_GITHUB_URL
    to decide when to record this data

Every time the tests run, the results are written to a directory/file

Capabilities:

    - def compare(original: Branch, new: Branch): PerformanceDiff


Questions:
- Timestamp results? More generally - do we want to keep a list of results, or just the latest?

{
  "results": [
    {
       // TODO Include error/failure details w/o ansi colors
       // TODO Include line number if possible
       // TODO  stderr/stdout
       "name" : "zio.test.results.ResultFileOpsJsonSpec/ResultFileOpsJsonSpec/simple write",
       "status" : "Success",
       "durationMillis" : "353",
       "annotations" : "ignored: 1",
       "fullyQualifiedClassName" : "zio.test.results.ResultFileOpsJsonSpec",
       "labels" : ["ResultFileOpsJsonSpec", "simple write"]
    }
  ]
}
